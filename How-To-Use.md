# How to use this template

### 1. Create your own repo from this template 

- [With this generator link](https://github.com/daVinci2793/CTF-Writeup-Template/generate)

- Name the repo whatever you'd like, but including the name of the event is ideal ;D

- Please keep the TOS of the event in which you are participating in mind. You may have to make this repo private during the event. 
  - This is also just good etiquette.

### 2. You will likely need to update the GitHub Actions perms to allow read-write

- Select the repo -> Settings -> Actions -> General -> Workflow Permissions -> Read and write permissions

### 3. Clone the repo to your local development environment. 

- Make the updates in the step below this one before performing your first push. 

### 4. Update the event URL in the [.automation/Change-Me/event.txt](.automation/Change-Me/event.txt) with the [CTF Time](https://ctftime.org/) link for the event. 

- This allows the CTF Time API integration to auto-populate the details for the Top-Level README.

### 5. Start writing your write-ups!

- There is an [example write-up](Crypto/Example/) in the Crypto folder; it will give you some general guidance. 

### 6. Include your incomplete research and write-ups too! 

### 7. When you are ready, delete this "How-To-Use."
